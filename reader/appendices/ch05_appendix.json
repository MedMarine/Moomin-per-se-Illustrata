    "explanation": "The illustrations show scenes that already happened. いた is the past of いる: スニフがいた！ あった is the past of ある. だった is the past of だ: あれはスニフだった.\n\nPast + が often signals discovery — the moment of finding out. スニフがいた！ is the shock of realization.\n\nRe-read the chapter: which sentences describe discovery (past + が) and which describe completed states?"
