    "title": "Past Tense: た and だった",
    "explanation": "Japanese marks the past by changing the verb or copula ending. いる → いた (was there, animate), ある → あった (was there, inanimate), だ → だった (was). Past tense with が often expresses discovery: スニフがいた！ (Sniff was [here]! — I just found out). The た ending will appear on all verbs going forward.",
