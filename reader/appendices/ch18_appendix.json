    "explanation": "て-form + いる describes a state. It has two faces.\n\nThe Rolling Camera — action in progress. When ムーミン says 動いている, look at the illustration: the plant is actively curling. The camera catches an action mid-way.\n\nThe Aftermath — result still visible. 茸が落ちている — the mushroom is not falling now. It already fell, and there it sits. The camera shows what remains after a change.\n\n変わっている — this place HAS changed (and still shows it). Re-read and sort: is each ている a rolling camera or an aftermath?"
