    "explanation": "Watch ムーミン on the beach. He spots something: 貝殻があった！ — が marks the shell as a discovery.\n\nThe next line: この貝殻はいい！ — は marks the same shell, now established, being commented on.\n\nが = the moment of noticing. は = talking about something already in view.\n\nWatch this shift throughout the chapter: が appears at moments of surprise, は appears when commenting on something established."
