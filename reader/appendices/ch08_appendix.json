    "title": "Motion: いく, くる, and へ",
    "explanation": "へ points a direction. 海へいく — toward the sea, moving away.\n\nWhen ムーミン says スナフキンがくる, look at the illustration: Snufkin approaches, coming toward the viewer. いく moves away from here, くる moves toward here.\n\n帰る carries its own destination: 家へ帰る — returning home.\n\nRe-read and trace the motion: who goes, who comes, who returns? Which direction does each verb point?"
