    "explanation": "は picks up something already visible and comments on it. あの人はだれ？ — pointing at someone in view, asking about them.\n\nだ declares what something is: フローレンだ！ — identifying the figure.\n\nNotice the shift from が to は: 山がある (a mountain appears) vs. いい山だ (that mountain — now established — is nice). が introduces, は comments.\n\nWatch for は and だ in every line. Which sentences introduce and which ones comment?"
