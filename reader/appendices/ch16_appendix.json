    "title": "て-Form: Linking and Requesting",
    "explanation": "The て-form links actions or makes requests. こちらにきて！ — a request to come here. おりてきて！ — two actions chained: descend, then come.\n\n飛行をみて、あそこへいく — look at the flight, then go there. て connects what happens first to what follows.\n\nNotice: きて is a request (come!), きた is past (came). The て-form is open-ended, pointing to what comes next.\n\nRe-read and find every て. Is it linking actions or making a request?"
