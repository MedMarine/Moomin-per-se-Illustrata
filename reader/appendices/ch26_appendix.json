    "explanation": "の and こと turn a verb phrase into a noun. 追うのはひどい — chasing (as a thing) is terrible. 返すことが必要だ — returning (as a thing) is necessary.\n\n花をみるのが楽しいね — looking at flowers (the activity, packaged as a noun) is fun. The の wraps the whole action into something that が or は can mark.\n\nFrom here forward, の and こと appear constantly. Watch for [verb] + の or [verb] + こと followed by は, が, or を."
