    "explanation": "A new pattern appears: 友達がくるそうだ — friends are coming, I hear. 降るそうだ — it will rain, they say. きたそうだ — [someone] came, apparently.\n\nそうだ attaches to a whole clause and means 'I hear that.' This is different from the そう you learned early on (which means 'that's right').\n\n眠るのはまだだめだ — sleeping is still not allowed. The の pattern continues alongside the new そうだ.\n\nRe-read and find every そうだ. What is reported?"
