    "title": "Desire: たい",
    "explanation": "たい attaches to a verb stem and expresses wanting. 助けたい — want to help. 水を取りたい — want to take the water. 水を出したい — want to get the water out.\n\nたい behaves like an い-adjective: it sits at the end, no だ needed. And it only expresses the speaker's own desire.\n\nRe-read and notice: who says たい, and what do they want?"
