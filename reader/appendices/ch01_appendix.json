    "explanation": "A noun by itself is a complete utterance. When you read 船 — look at the illustration. That single word IS the sentence.\n\nNotice the comma pattern: わたし、ムーミン。 The comma equates two things. The pause is the grammar. No verb, no copula — just two nouns placed side by side.\n\nRe-read the chapter and watch for single-noun utterances and comma-equations. Every line works this way."
